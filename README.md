# Fly Casual Legacy

I have two primary goals with this fork FlyCasual:
* Implement the Heroes of the Aturi Cluster Campaign
* Port any newly added version 2.5 ships and upgrades to version 2.0

Added Features:
* Campaign Game Mode
* Rebel Pilot Abilities as Upgrades for HotAC ships
* 'Hotac Pilots' option under the 'Mods' menu which allows using custom HotAC pilots in other game modes
* 'Elite Imperial Pilots' option under the 'Mods' menu which allows using custom Imperial pilots and abilities in other game modes

Notes:
* I'm learning Unity, C#, and Github as I go, so things will be slow, inconsistent and error prone
* If anyone wants to throw any money my way for some reason you can do that [here](patreon.com/user?u=84527220).

Thanks:
* Sandrem for creating FlyCasual
* The X-Wing Legacy group for continuing to support 2.0 points for new releases.
* Josh Derkson, Sean Tiernan and all the folks that helped create the HotAC campaign and its 2.0 version
* Jim Bob of Infinite Arenas who provided the tools I used to make all the custom cards for this
