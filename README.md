# Fly Casual HotAC Campaign Mod

I have two primary goals with this fork FlyCasual:
* Implement the Heroes of the Aturi Cluster Campaign
* Port any newly added version 2.5 ships and upgrades to version 2.0

Added Features:
* Campaign Game Mode
* Rebel Pilot Abilities as Upgrades for HotAC ships

Notes:
* I'm learning Unity, C#, and Github as I go, so things will be slow, inconsistent and error prone

Thanks:
* Sandrem for creating FlyCasual (his Patreon is [here](https://www.patreon.com/Sandrem))
* Josh Derkson, Sean Tiernan and all the folks that helped create the HotAC campaign and its 2.0 version
* Jim Bob of Infinite Arenas who provided the tools I used to make all the custom cards for this
